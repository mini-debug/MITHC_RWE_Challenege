We are assessing two potential siting locations in the U.S. for a large-load industrial or data-center customer. We will “grade” each location based on the following weighted criteria:

1. **Grid availability (40%)** — How easily and cost-effectively we can connect a large load, considering distribution system hosting capacity, transmission infrastructure, and interconnection risk.  
2. **Access to renewable energy (30%)** — Proportion of generation in the region from renewables, especially wind, solar, and clean sources, and the likelihood of procurement or power purchase agreements (PPAs) from clean energy.  
3. **Government regulations (10%)** — The strength of clean-energy policy in the state (e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), clean energy or carbon-free targets, regulatory risk or support).

Any other relevant siting factors (land cost, permitting risk, environmental risk, distance to grid, etc.) should be considered together and split evenly with whatever weighting remains (i.e. 20%).

Compare **Location A** and **Location B**, using real, publicly available data, and compute a weighted grade for each location. Then recommend which site is better based on your grade.

Use U.S.-based data sources (e.g., DOE hosting capacity maps, EIA generation by source, state clean energy standards) rather than made-up numbers. Provide your reasoning, data sources, and assumptions.

**Location candidates to compare**:  
- **Location A**: *Iowa (central / mid-west)* — high wind generation share  
- **Location B**: *Texas (e.g., in ERCOT region)* — large grid, lots of renewables, but regulatory complexity  

Compute a score out of 100 for each location given the weights, and choose which is better.
